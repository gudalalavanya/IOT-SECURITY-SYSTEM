**About--
    **Applicable Areas â€“ Paragraph Format
The IoT-based security system developed in this project has a wide range of real-world applications. In home security, it can be used to monitor entry points, detect unauthorized access, and capture images of intruders, thereby enhancing the safety of residents. In offices and commercial buildings, the system can help secure sensitive areas like server rooms or finance departments by detecting motion and logging activity. Educational institutions such as schools and colleges can use this system to protect labs, examination halls, and restricted zones after hours. At construction sites, it can be deployed to prevent theft of tools or materials and monitor site activity, especially at night. The system is also suitable for parking lots and garages to detect movement near vehicles and prevent unauthorized parking. In shops and warehouses, it acts as a low-cost surveillance solution to monitor inventory areas and customer activity. Furthermore, it can be implemented as a smart doorbell or entrance monitoring system, capturing images of every visitor and sending real-time alerts. For remote surveillance, such as farmhouses, vacation homes, or isolated facilities, it provides an efficient way to monitor without physical presence. Lastly, in industrial environments, the system can ensure safety by detecting motion in hazardous areas and maintaining activity logs for audits.
